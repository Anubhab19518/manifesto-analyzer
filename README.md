# Political Manifesto Analyzer

An intelligent, full-stack web application designed to bring clarity and unbiased analysis to political discourse. This tool allows users to upload political manifesto PDFs and receive an instant, AI-powered breakdown of their content, tone, and key focus areas.

The application is built to be user-friendly, providing easy-to-understand reports, comparisons, and accessibility features to make complex political documents accessible to everyone.

## ‚ú® Features

*AI-Powered Analysis*: Upload a PDF and get a comprehensive report generated by Google's Gemini API.

*Dynamic Party Recognition*: The AI automatically detects the political party from the manifesto's text.

*In-Depth Reporting*: Each report includes:
* A concise, neutral summary.
* Identification of key themes (e.g., Economy, Healthcare).
* Overall sentiment analysis (e.g., Optimistic, Pragmatic).
* A detailed breakdown of relevance and specific policies for different voter groups (Youth, Seniors, Farmers, Corporate Sector).

*Side-by-Side Comparison*: Select any two analyzed manifestos to generate an insightful "Face-Off" comparison, highlighting key differences and voter appeal.

### Accessibility Features:

* *Text-to-Speech*: Listen to any summary with a single click.
* *Translation*: Translate summaries into local languages (e.g., Bengali).

### Robust Backend:

* *API Fallback*: Automatically switches from Gemini to the DeepSeek API if rate limits are reached, ensuring high availability.
* *Intelligent Caching*: Analyzes each unique PDF only once, saving API costs and providing instant results for subsequent requests.
* *Smart Text Filtering*: Pre-processes PDFs to extract only the most relevant text, optimizing API usage and improving analysis quality.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
* Node.js (v18 or later)
* Python (v3.9 or later)
* Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project to your local machine:

bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/manifesto-analyzer.git](https://github.com/your-username/manifesto-analyzer.git)
cd manifesto-analyzer

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory and set up the Python environment.

bash
cd backend


Create and activate a virtual environment:

On Windows (PowerShell):

bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate


On macOS/Linux:

bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Create your environment file:

Create a new file named .env inside the backend folder.

Add your secret API keys to this file:


GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_deepseek_api_key_here"


### 3. Frontend Setup
In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend directory.

bash
cd frontend


Install dependencies:

bash
npm install

### 4. Running the Application
You need to run both the backend and frontend servers concurrently in their respective terminals.

Start the Backend Server (in the backend terminal):

bash
uvicorn app:app --reload

The backend will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Start the Frontend Server (in the frontend terminal):

bash
npm run dev

The frontend will be running at http://localhost:3000.

You can now open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to use the application.

## ‚òÅ Deployment
This application is designed to be deployed with a split architecture for best performance and scalability.

Backend (Python/FastAPI): The backend can be deployed as a Web Service on a platform like Render. Remember to set the API keys as environment variables in the Render dashboard.

Frontend (Next.js): The frontend is best deployed on Vercel or Render. You will need to set a NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL environment variable that points to your live backend URL.
